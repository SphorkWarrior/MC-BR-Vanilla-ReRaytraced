# MC-BR-Vanilla-ReRaytraced
A combination of multiple Minecraft Bedrock RayTracing Texture Packs that make the game look awesome. This pack includes parts of: Vanilla Raytraced (github.com/MazeWave/Vanilla-Raytraced), Vanilla-RTX (github.com/CubeIR/Vanilla-RTX),  Bloody-Nether, and a few of my own tweaks.
